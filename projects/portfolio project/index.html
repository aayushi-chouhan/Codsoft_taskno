            <h3>Basic Calculator</h3>
            <p>
                The Basic Calculator is a simple, yet functional web-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project was developed as part of my web development portfolio to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary objective of this project was to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that replicates the functionality of a physical calculator. The calculator is designed with a clean and modern aesthetic, ensuring ease of use and accessibility for all users.
            </p>
            <h4>Features:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division</li>
                <li>Responsive Design: Ensures usability across different devices and screen sizes</li>
                <li>Keyboard Support: Users can perform calculations using both mouse clicks and keyboard inputs</li>
                <li>Clear Functionality: Easily reset the calculator to perform new calculations</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML: Provides the structure of the calculator, including buttons and display areas</li>
                <li>CSS: Styles the calculator with a modern and clean design, ensuring responsiveness</li>
                <li>JavaScript: Implements the logic for performing calculations and updating the display in real-time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation. It also provided an opportunity to practice CSS for creating a responsive and visually appealing layout. The Basic Calculator is a testament to my ability to build functional web applications from scratch and my commitment to creating user-centric designs.
